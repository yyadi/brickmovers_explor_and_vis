![Proj](https://img.shields.io/badge/proj-wip-yellowgreen.svg)

## 1. Data Exploration
### Task 1
- Read the instructions in the sample notebook [`exploration.ipynb`](./code/exploration.ipynb) saved under [brickmovers_explor_and_vis/code](./code) to perform the task
- Save the answer as `exploration_<yourname>.ipynb` under the same folder
- The data required are saved under [brickmovers_explor_and_vis/data](./data)

### Task 2
- Read the instructions in the sample notebook [`loan_data.ipynb`](./code/loan_data.ipynb) saved under [brickmovers_explor_and_vis/code](./code) to perform the task
- Save the answer as `loan_data_<yourname>.ipynb` under the same folder
- The data required are saved under [brickmovers_explor_and_vis/data](./data)

### Task 3
- Read the instructions in the sample notebook [`visualization_data.ipynb`](./code/visualization_data.ipynb) saved under [brickmovers_explor_and_vis/code](./code) to perform the task
- Save the answer as `visualization_data_final.ipynb` under the same folder
- The data required are saved under [brickmovers_explor_and_vis/data](./data)
- You should only **work on your branch**. You can **push your changes to master branch** and **pull the latest changes by others from the master branch**
- You should discuss with the team the changes being made **before** pushing to master branch

### Task 4
Part 1:
- Read the code [`simple_linear_regression.py`](./code/simple_linear_regression.py) saved under [brickmovers_explor_and_vis/code](./code)
- The data required are saved under [brickmovers_explor_and_vis/data](./data)
- Put the the code into a notebook `simple_linear_regression_<yourname>.ipynb`
- You will need to install the packages and modify the paths in order to run the code
- You should only **work on your branch**. You can **push your changes to master branch**
